##  Grunt proxy plugin

- this will proxy calls to a certain endpoint to a host and port of your choice.
- set it up to proxy `/api/v1` to `localhost` port `3000`
- Any Yeoman `/api/v1` endpoints will be in my rails app under `localhost:3000/api/v1`

So it essentially feels like i am in the public directory of my rails app, when I am not.
